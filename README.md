# Pomodoro Timer

## Code structure based off of a tutorial

## I've taken the basic code provided from ChatGPT and modified it to add features

### Original code only had one timer with a preset value, a start button and a reset button

### I have added a stop button, as well as functionality to disable the buttons based on whether the timer is running, stopped or reset

### Steps:
I. Create the basic HTML structure  
  A. Create file index.html and type "!" to get the basic HTML structure  
  B. Change the App Title  
  C. Add the link for the stylesheet underneath the <title>  
  D. Build the structure for the timer:  
    1. Create a div  
    2. Add the timer text  
    3. Add buttons for Start and Reset  
  E. Add the script and link up the script.js file  
  F. Create the style.css file  
II. Add basic styling to the application in the style.css file  
III. Add functionality with the script.js file
